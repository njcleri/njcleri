### Nikko J. Cleri - PhD Student at Texas A&M University

Welcome to my GitHub! I am Nikko Cleri (he/him/his), astronomy PhD student at Texas A&M University, where I study galaxy evolution through emission-line spectroscopy of systems in the early Universe. I primarily use data from JWST and HST, and I am a member of the CEERS (Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science), NGDEEP (Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public Survey), and CLEAR (CANDELS Lyman-alpha Emission at Reionization) collaborations. 

Feel free to look through my repositories here or check out my personal website at [tx.ag/cleri](https://tx.ag/cleri). Contact he here or via email at cleri@tamu.edu.

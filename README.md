### Nikko J. Cleri - PhD Student at Texas A&M University

Welcome to my GitHub! I am an astronomy PhD student at Texas A&M University, where I study emission-line galaxies. My current works include a study of near-infrared star-formation through hydrogen emission lines in the Paschen series, and a study of a population of extremely high ionization HeII and NeV emitting galaxies. 

Feel free to look through my repositories here or check out my personal website at [tx.ag/cleri](https://tx.ag/cleri).
